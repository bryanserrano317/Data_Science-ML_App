These scripts are designed to analyze SAXS data gathered on spherical miscelles with a Gaussian and Log-Normal size distribution. Cylindrical micelles are considered, as well. Distribution, scattering amplitude, and scattering intensity equations are used to provide a line of best fit that allows for greater investigation of micelle characteristics.

Implemented segmented regression analysis through scikit-learn to curve fit real-world data consisting of multiple linear and polynomial graph segments.

Curve Fitting (Each color represents a seperate analysis):
